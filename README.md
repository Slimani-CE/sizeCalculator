# sizeCalculator
A simple size calculator for html maps coordinates.

the problem is when you are trying to make a map of an image and you found that you want to you a different size of the image so you want tou change the coordinates of your map 
you can just give this programme the old coords(coords should be separated by ',' no spaces no  nothing, "at least just for this vol of programmeðŸ˜…") and the origin width(or the heigth) of the image and the old width(or heigth) to give you the new coord of your map
